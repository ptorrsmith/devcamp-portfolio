                <p>I've been living in Wellington since 1993 and for much of that time have worked in IT delivery for private-sector, Government and start-up businesses in technical, analytical and team management and delivery roles. </p>
                <p>I now spend time between Auckland and Wellington, and have been enjoying remote working and the challenges and opportunities that presents.</p>

                <%= render partial: 'shared/roles_quals_cv' %>

                <p>I've recently completed 19 months contracting fully remote as a senior engineer for Flux Federation working on their enterprise electricity and gas billing platform.</p>
                <p>Much of my work there has been involved in designing and implementing new APIs for external and interal consumption. This was to progress the platform to support new Open Data regulations in the Australian market, and to start extracting services out from the core Ruby on Rails monolith. </p>
                <p>Some highlights have been:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Using OpenAPI to define the APIs, code generation from this to create common reusable classes for the development teams</li>
                        <li> Analysis, design and implementation and enhancement of new and existing APIs
                            <li> Core APIs to support new microservices</li>
                            <li> Core APIs to comply with Consumer Open Data regulations</li>
                            <li> API extensions for the mobile app</li>                            
                        </li>
                        <li> Working closely with external teams and stakeholders to support their adoption of these new APIs</li>
                        <li> Using PlantUML to document the current and future state for new services and application refactoring </li>
                        <li> Analysing performance issues in core code and background jobs, and implementing solutions to address these</li>
                        <li> System financial data audits and fixes</li>
                        <li> Implementing new features and enhancements to the core customer billing platform</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Prior to that I had a wonderful year as a senior engineer with <%= link_to 'AskYourTeam', 'https://askyourteam.com/', target: "_blank" %> in their Wellington team enhancing their Ruby on Rails and React enterprise survey platform. This is hosted with AWS and fully managed with Cloud Formation templates. I led several new features including implementing a full organisation hiearchy/structure management facility using and extending the <%= link_to 'Ancestry gem', 'https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry', target: "_blank" %>, and pair-building the automation of user permissions automatically derived from this structure.  I have implemented, and migrated, many aspects of the application functionality to asynchronous / background job processing, initially using <%= link_to 'Delayed Job', 'https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job', target: "_blank" %>, but recently we migrated everying over to <%= link_to 'Good Job', 'https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job', target: "_blank" %>.  I also led the design and implementation of a number of integrations with Hubspot using their Private Apps APIs so the sales and customer support team were alway up to date with what our customers (accounts and users) are doing with the platform.</p>

                        <p>In 2023 I sat and passed my AWS Certified Cloud Developer Associate exam (DVA-C02), assisted by this Udemy course:  <%= link_to 'Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2023 NEW DVA-C02', 'https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/', target: '_blank' %> (<a class="" data-toggle="collapse" href="#awscertificate" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="awscertificate">Udemy certificate</a>), course and study matrials from <%= link_to 'A Cloud Guru', 'https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate', target: '_blank' %>, and plenty of reading and hands on.</p>

                <p>Prior to AskYourTeam, I was contracting fully remote to <%= link_to 'Culture Amp', 'https://cultureamp.com/', target: "_blank" %> as a senior engineer for their 'Performance' product.  For much of this I was primarily focused on back-end performance and enhancements: APIs, DB query optimization, asynchronous job processing, and code restructuring to support domain isolation, laying the foundations for extracting domains out from the Ruby on Rails monolith.</p>

                <p>In late 2020 I had the privilege of doing a short contract with the <a href="https://resn.co.nz" target="_blank">Resn Digital</a> team as one of their Technical Directors. Here I've helped scope out and investigate technical approaches for a number of digital projects in the pipeline, and to help make the <a href="https://goodmeat.co" target="_blank">GOOD Meat launch experience</a> a reality :-) (the site experience we made is no longer publically available as it was only for their initial launch)</p>

                <p>2019/2020 I did a number of upgrades for <a href="http://www.hirethings.com" target="_blank">HireThings.com / .co.nz / com.au</a> towards a more appropriate style and focus required of a modern useful online service. This included upgrading from Ruby on Rails 2 to 5, re-architecting the application and shifting onto Amazon Web Services, enabling continuous deployments, and giving the service a full mobile-first refresh based on the Bootstrap framework. I've also mentored a couple of younger developers during that journey.</p>

                <p>2011 - 2018 I worked with the Ministry of Social Development on IT business projects & programmes for a wide range of business services and applications. These have been mainly web applications and the shift to mobile-first web.</p>

                <p>To refresh and modernize my technical skills and prepare for the upgrade work on Hire Things, I did the excellent <%= link_to 'Enspiral Dev Academy Bootcamp', 'https://devacademy.co.nz/', target: "_blank" %> over the last quarter of 2018. Here with a great bunch of students and coaches we were immersed in a world of Javascript, frameworks, modern web app development with React, and team challenges. The EDA <%= link_to 'Graduation Letter', '/docs/Graduation certificate for Peter Torr Smith.pdf', target: "_blank" %> covers it quite well</p>

                <p>I then spent several weeks <a class="" data-toggle="collapse" href="#certificate" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="certificate">completing</a> this fantasic and challenging <%= link_to 'Rails Professional Udemy course', 'https://www.udemy.com/professional-rails-5-development-course/', target: '_blank' %>. It was very detailed, and the result of my efforts was this website (hosted on Heroku), <%= link_to 'ptorrsmith.com', 'http://www.ptorrsmith.com' %>, built from scratch with Rails 5 (I've since upgraded this to Rails 6.1 and ruby 3.2).
