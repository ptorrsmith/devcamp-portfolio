<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've been living in Wellington since 1993 and in that time have worked in IT, Government and start-up businesses in
    many different roles</p>
<p>I've recently finished several years working with the Ministry of Social Development working on projects, programmes
    and portfolios of a wide range of business services and applications. These have been mainly web applications and
    for the last few years mobile web.</p>
<p>I had a great time doing the Enspiral Dev Academy Bootcamp 'Hihi' at the end of 2018, and am now using that
    confidence, skills and awareness to explore new online business ventures and opportunities.</p>
<p>My current focus is upgrading <a href="http://www.hirethings.com">Hire Things</a> to a more appropriate style and
    focus required of a modern useful online service</p>
<p>I love business, technology, governance, finance, food and fermentation, swimming, art, living in Aro Valley, and
    spending time with my partner on our various projects and going on adventures :-)</p>
<p>I enjoy getting in and helping make a business, team, technology and process work, and I like being part of that
    business. I'd love to explore business opportunities with you and see what great things we can make happen</p>
